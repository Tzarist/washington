But after a falling out with his father, he strived to carve out his own destiny. Soon Hamlin would use connections he made through his law cilents to achieve a position as an assistent to the New England Secretary of Trade, Winston Churchill. Him and Churchill would boost a great friendship, one so much so that when Churchill would be appointed to become Prime Minister of New England, he appointed Hamlin in his former post. Hamlin's career as Secretary of Trade would see an even greater dominance of British corporate grip over the New Englandish economy. During this period, Hamlin would make great connections with several British CEO's and MP's which would garner Hamlin the reputation of being economically savy and a loyalist to the crown. After the collapse of the London Stock Exchange in 1931, the British government would sack many government officals but Hamlin was spared. This is where Hamlin would achieve his big break, he would be offered the position of Governor of the far away Crown Colony of Shanghai with the hopes that Hamlin could work some of his so called "economic magic" and turn the Orient's Crown City to an economic powerhouse once again that would benefit the British Empire. Hamlin would thus become Governor of Shanghai in 1935 but he wasn't prepared for the chaos that would be the far east. Hamlin quickly realized he was in a far awa land, and that Shanghai was far different then New England. He had a population that hated him, while also having to contend with the ever-changing political landscape of East Asia. So the question is will Hamlin use that same determination that led him to become Governor, or succumb to the chaotic city that is Shanghai?"
